## Response snapshot

I have completed Task 27 by implementing the chat endpoint and data models in `api/main.py`. I have also updated the task's status to "DONE".

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The FastAPI application now has the chat endpoint and data models, ready for the RAG logic to be implemented.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Modified 2 files.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Execute the next incomplete task (Task 28).
- 🧠 Reflection: This task sets up the API structure for the chatbot.
