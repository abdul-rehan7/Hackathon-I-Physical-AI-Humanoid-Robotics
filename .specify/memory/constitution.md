# Project Constitution

## 1. Code Quality
- **Readability:** Code should be clean, well-structured, and easy to understand.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be easy to modify and extend.
- **Consistency:** Adhere to established coding styles and conventions (e.g., Docusaurus best practices, TypeScript guidelines).
- **Modularity:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable modules or components.

## 2. Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests for critical functions and components.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure different parts of the system work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Verify the overall functionality of the application.
- **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage, especially for core logic.

## 3. Performance
- **Efficiency:** Optimize code for performance, especially in critical paths.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the application is responsive and provides a good user experience.
- **Scalability:** Design for future growth and increased load.

## 4. Security
- **Vulnerability Prevention:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
- **Data Protection:** Handle sensitive data securely, both in transit and at rest.
- **Dependency Security:** Regularly audit and update third-party dependencies to mitigate security risks.

## 5. Architecture
- **Simplicity:** Prefer simple and straightforward solutions over overly complex ones.
- **Flexibility:** Design the architecture to be adaptable to changing requirements.
- **Reusability:** Promote the reuse of components and modules.
- **Documentation:** Document architectural decisions and system design.

## 6. Documentation
- **Clarity:** Documentation should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- **Accuracy:** Keep documentation up-to-date with the current state of the project.
- **Completeness:** Provide sufficient information for users and developers to understand and use the system.

## 7. Collaboration
- **Version Control:** Use Git for version control and follow a clear branching strategy.
- **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to ensure quality and share knowledge.
- **Communication:** Maintain open and effective communication within the team.
