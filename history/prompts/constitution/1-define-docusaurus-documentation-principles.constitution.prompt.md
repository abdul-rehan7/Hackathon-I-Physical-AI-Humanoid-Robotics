## Prompt

Edit the 'constitution.md' file to define principles for Docusaurus documentation, focusing on clean React components and TypeScript best practices. Ensure the resulting content follows the existing structure of the file.

## Response snapshot

I have updated the `constitution.md` file with principles for Docusaurus documentation, focusing on clean React components and TypeScript best practices.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Defined the core principles for the Docusaurus documentation site.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Modified 1 file: `book-project-specify/.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User might want to start creating content or components based on these principles.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of reading the existing file, understanding its structure, and then replacing the content worked well. The PHR creation is a good way to document the actions taken.
